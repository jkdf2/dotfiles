Promptastic: fantastic prompt for Bash
======================================

*Promptastic* is a flavored **prompt** for [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
which provides info about the running **system** and **environment** in a fancy **colored** output.
It works under **Mac OS X** and **Linux**.

See [Info.md](https://github.com/nimiq/promptastic/blob/master/Info.md) for more info and
screenshots.

This project is heavily inspired by [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline)
and [Powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell/) which I have been using for
a long time and realized that the former is complicated to install, slightly bloated and more
suitable for [Vi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) users, while the latter is unmaintained and a bit buggy.

*Promptastic* has a [project page](http://painl.es/promptastic/) in my website.
